# Decluttered

Crafting block variants is a thing of the past - allows you to use a hotkey to easily swap between variants.

## FAQ

- Will this mod be ported to other versions/loaders?
    - This mod actively supports the latest version of Minecraft (currently 1.21.8). There is no plan to backport to older versions or any other loaders, as to not compete with [Clutter No More](https://modrinth.com/mod/clutter-no-more).
